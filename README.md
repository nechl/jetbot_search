# jetbot_search
With this software, the jetbot should be able to search inside a room for a certain object of the [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
Whatsoever, the computing power of the jetbot is to little that the jetbot can really drive on its own. Due to the little computing power, the object detection/ obstacle avoidance is not fast enough for the given resolution/ velocity of the robot.

Based on the [NVIDIA AI IOT Jetbot Notebooks](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot)
